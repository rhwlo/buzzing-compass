More to come here, but:

The **buzzing_compass** project is a project to create a wearable compass that signals the direction
to its wearer using two cell phone vibration motors. Eventually I’d like to post a circuit diagram
and maybe a printable pattern, but for the moment it’s just me muddling around with things. The main
branch, “stable”, should always be something that can be built properly.
